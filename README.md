- A **large language model trained on 500 of my own Quiplash responses**.
- Fine-tuned the trained on the [Mistral-7B-Instruct Model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3) using **[Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth)** for quick and efficient training.
- Designed to generate funny (and wildly inappropriate) answers to Quiplash prompts.
